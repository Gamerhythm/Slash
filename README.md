# Slash

This is a semi-realistic AI bot based on ChatterBot with a built in Nazi filter. It also comes with a built in database from when I ran the bot for around a day, even though you can add your own and it will automatically add to that database the smarter your bot gets. To activate the bot, mention your bot at the beginning of the message.
# Setup

Setup is extremely simple. Firstly, ensure you have Python 3.6 and pip installed. Then, create a bot user on the Discord developers website and then put the token in token.txt. Then, simply run the bot and it will install everything you need.
